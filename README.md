# Slot Machine Python Program

## How It Works
This slot machine has a grid size that can be modified by the programmer, but starts off as a 3x3 grid. A player can deposit money and bet on any number of lines/columns between 1 and the MAX_BET (3). The player then chooses how much money they would like to bet on each line and spin the machine. After each spin, the player is asked if they would like to keep playing or quit. When a user reaches a balance of 0, they are required to deposit more money if they wish to keep playing.

## How to Win
A player wins money for each row in which they achieve 3 in a row on the spin. Each symbol on the slot machine has a specific multiplier. The player's bet will get multiplied by the value of the multiplier for the row in which they won. 

## ***Note:***
**THIS IS NOT A REAL SLOT MACHINE.** No real money is being taken or rewarded. This program may not reflect a real-life slot machine. Values are selected with an RNG, but may not be selected in the same manner as a real-life slot machine. Rules may also be altered.
